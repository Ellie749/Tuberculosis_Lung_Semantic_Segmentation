# Tuberculosis Lung Semantic Segmentation

This project focuses on the segmentation of lung regions affected by tuberculosis from medical imaging data. The goal is to leverage semantic segmentation techniques to accurately identify and localize the affected areas.

## Objectives

- Develop a model to perform semantic segmentation of tuberculosis-infected lung regions.
- Enhance diagnostic precision and support medical professionals.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: Utilizes publicly available tuberculosis imaging datasets.
  - [Chest X-Ray Lungs Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtapendu/chest-x-ray-lungs-segmentation).
- **Model**: U-Net based architecture.
- **Evaluation**:
